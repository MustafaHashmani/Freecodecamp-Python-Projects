# Projects

1. Cipher
   - Implemented a Caesar Cipher program for both encryption and decryption using a key
2. Luhn's Algorithm
   - Implemented Luhn's Algorithm for verifying credit card numbers
3. Expense Tracker
   - Implemented an Expense Tracker by exploring the power of Lambda Functions.
4. Case Converter
   - Implemented a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.
   - The project has two phases: first I used a for loop to implement
     the program. Then I used List Comprehension instead of a loop to
     achieve the same results.
