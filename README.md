## Projects

1. Cipher
   - Implemented a Caesar Cipher program for both encryption and decryption using a key
2. Luhn's Algorithm
   - Implemented Luhn's Algorithm for verifying credit card numbers
3. Expense Tracker
   - Implemented an Expense Tracker by exploring the power of Lambda Functions.
4. Case Converter
   - Implemented a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.
   - The project has two phases: first I used a for loop to implement
     the program. Then I used List Comprehension instead of a loop to
     achieve the same results.
5. Password Generator
   - Learnt how to import modules from the Python standard library by using Regular Expressions to build my own password generator program.
6. Shortest Path Algorithm:
   - Implemented the Shortest Path Algorithm on a graph using list and dictionary comprehension.
7. Tower of Hanoi
   - Solved the famous Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.
8. Merge Sort
   - Implemented The Merge Sort Algorithm which is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle using recursion.
9. Sudoku Solver
   - learnt how to use classes and objects to build a Sudoku grid and solve a Sudoku puzzle.
10. Binary Search Tree
    - learnt how to construct my own BST and perform an in-order traversal by performing key operations like insertion, search, and deletion.
